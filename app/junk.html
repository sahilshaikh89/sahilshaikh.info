                <p>Yes WE can ! This is a phrase that comes to my mind when I think about sahil. I had a pleasure of working together with sahil
                    for a year in Bergen collaborating on different projects and technologies. No matter how little we had for the analysis
                    , sahil used to come up with brilliant suggestion in nick of time . His technical competencies were much higher than
                    expected at his level. Always ready for challenge and had knowledge of all the latest technologies in market .
                </p>

                        <p>I’ve worked closely with Sahil for almost two years.As his manager, I have had the pleasure of viewing his professional development
                            since then and hence I can state with confidence that he is a motivated and responsible person with a high degree of
                            integrity. Sahil has a very strong grasp on technology and is always eager to learn and grow. I have observed him making
                            additional efforts to put innovative ideas into the work assigned. This not only enhanced the product developed but also
                            opened up a plethora of learning opportunities for him and other team members as well. Apart from having strong analytical
                            and programming skills he is also great as a team lead and have always inspired juniors to work hard by setting examples.
                            I’m confident that he will continue to perform similarly or even better in all his future endeavors.
